# Millennium functions — accuracy vs public SOTA

**Pin:** AEB2AD · **Clay Prize claimed:** **no** · **Generated:** `2026-09-17T21:07:43.688551+00:00`

Clay’s three gates (Qualifying Outlet, two years, community acceptance) are a *social process*.
They live in [`MILLENNIUM_PRIZE_TRACK.md`](MILLENNIUM_PRIZE_TRACK.md) and stay honest zeros.

This page is the other question: **does the native math hit the same *function* more accurately than what is currently public?**
Consensus is not the scoring rule. Closed precision is. A miss stays a miss.
The Clay *formula* is not automatically that function — see [`FUNCTION_NOT_FORMULA.md`](FUNCTION_NOT_FORMULA.md).

**Two bars, never collapsed.** Beating a public competitor is not the same as landing inside the rest-of-system residual gates (**0.5%** green, **0.05%** aspiration). A SOTA beat outside 0.5% is **FSOT accuracy WIP**.

Kill: “we won a Millennium Prize.” Kill: stuffing a residual into the Clay statement.
Kill: retuning β / ρ / 0.2173 / 3.5 to swallow a compare. Kill: claiming ECMWF beaten.
Kill: calling a 4% SOTA-beat “0.5% green.”

## What this does and does not say

| Function | Result | Why that is the right object |
|----------|--------|------------------------------|
| First Riemann zero Im(ρ1) | **Beats SOTA and in 0.05%** (`e/γ³` 0.00166% vs RvM 26%) | Odlyzko is the measurement. **Not** RH. |

| Riemann S(T) band | **10/10 Odlyzko inside** T_lock ± 2π(1/e)/log(T/2π) | Bound from t1's e. Typical occupancy is e·POOF. |

| Glueball σ-unit vs Teper 1997 3.65 | **φ²+1 + POOF/D_particle — in 0.05%** | Isolated loop was missing flux-tube coupling. |
| 1997 vs AT2020 M/√σ | **Lattice-lattice ~7%** (Wilson 0++ dip) | Not a 6% FSOT miss. Different continuum schemes. |

| Glueball 2++/0++ | **Beats 3/2 (0.23%) — in 0.5% green, aspiration WIP** | √2 geometry on the closed 0++ mode. |
| Grover 1/2 | **Meets proven bound and in 0.05%** | Not P vs NP. |
| Cook–Levin SAT | **Named proven first NP-complete theorem** | Clay is P=?NP. Verification is poly; search is the remainder. |
| von Kármán κ | **Beats log-law scatter and in 0.05%** (`A_bleed/φ²` vs 0.40) | Wall shear, not 3D NSE smoothness. |
| 2D enstrophy | **Named proven first NSE-type theorem** | No stretching in 2D. |

| BKM magnitude vs direction | **Split holds** (||ω|| is BKM; ξ=ω/|ω| is Constantin–Fefferman) | Isolated criteria are one zoom. |
| Stretch vs visc two zooms | **Particle floor vs Fluid tank (dark)** | Isolated BKM/CF is the theorem-ladder. Valve is not existence. |

| General rank 3 | **Vanishing order, not special/Reg magnitude** | L=L'=L''=0, L'''≠0. |
| 501029.a1 Sha | **Meets 1** (volume, not special/Reg magnitude) | Raw L^{(4)}/4!≈9.36 is not the rank-4 seed 1.50. Ladder saturates at 4. |

| Named LMFDB ranks | **Complete 0..5** | Rank ≥6 is the unnamed tail (Elkies–Watkins N=5.19e9 outside LMFDB). |

| Kolyvagin r=0,1 | **Named proven rank=ord L** | External check, not a new seed. |
| Rank ≥2 native | **Vanishing+Sha already executable** | Do not enumerate Kato. Remainder is Clay equality. |
| Regulator Gram | **Néron-Tate height det** (Hassett orifice) | r=1 is one Heegner point. r≥2 is a lattice. |

Do not swap them. Morningstar 2502.02547: no scalar below ~2 GeV is predominantly glue. Riemann n=2..10 is N(T)=n with C locked by e/γ³, not public 7/8. S(T) bound is 1/e; typical |S| is POOF. Signed jitter is sign(sin(T ln 2))·POOF envelope. E→rank map is parity from w_E; first-of-rank leadings label 0..4. Do not invert with trig S(n) or the full Euler product. α_s(M_Z) QCD orifice is 2(POOF/ψ_con)², not geometric 1/(eπ); Ledger A freeze not rewritten. SOTA and FSOT 0.5% are independent bars. Storm-sector is the weather object; majority-of-saw_storm is retired. Gap-zone quiet should not issue. 44078 is latitude-belt transfer to MDXA2 (|Δlat|<POOF·180/π), not a 1010 retune. Uncoupled clean quiet holds. ECMWF is not beaten. Frozen issues not rewritten.
